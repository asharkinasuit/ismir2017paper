This repository contains the code used for the paper entitled "A formalization
of relative local tempo variations in collections of performances" by Jeroen
Peperkamp, Klaus Hildebrandt and Cynthia Liem, as well as some examples of how
to use it, and some sample audio files in both MIDI and MP3 format.

In the work we made use of the MIRtoolbox version 1.6.1, as well as the Curve
Fitting Toolbox for MATLAB. The MATLAB version which was used in the experiments
was R2016b. We also rely on Dan Ellis' implementation of DTW, which is included
with these files, as well as the MIDICSV library (version 1.1), which is not.
Please compile dpcore.c before running the code.

See MIDI_and_real_performances.m for example code that applies a path to a MIDI,
and experiments_artificial.m for the code which was used to run the experiments
on artificial data. Further documentation is provided in the source code of the
various .m files.
